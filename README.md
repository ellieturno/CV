## Ellie Turnock

An enthusiastic, creative and highly motivated **Developer in-training.**

After 5 years in administrative roles mostly based in the property sector, I  am now studying a Full Stack developing course at Makers Academy where I have the opportunity to combine the things I enjoy with the things I am best at - building, problem solving and executing ideas.

Currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my existing knowledge whilst also having the opportunity to extend my learning in a challenging and supportive environment.

## Skills

#### Project Management

Seeing an idea come to fruition is one of my key motivators which is why whenever opportunities surrounding project management have come up in my past roles, I have always been the one to jump at them.
I have dealt with a range of different projects with vastly different scopes, heading these projects in both design and execution. Projects in my most recent role as Office Manager of Blockchain's London office include putting together a corporate retreat in Colorado for over 150 employees and guests and a full office design, fit-out and move - this occurred in the midst of a huge hiring event for the company so I was also challenged with maxing the capacity of our existing office to accommodate new team members.

#### Fast Learner

Having moved from the other side of the world at the ripe old age of 19, adaptability became a strength of mine very quickly and that has applied strongly to my work ethic and ability to learn. I like change, I like being thrown in the deep end and feel this is where I thrive.

I think the best example of this skill is what I'm doing right now. I am in the middle of a career change, learning an entirely new set of skills, languages, a new way of thinking. All of this in 3 short months.


#### Efficient

I have always considered myself a process driven individual, breaking down an end goal into the processes that will help me achieve it. I will not let anything within my control be any more difficult than it needs to be.

I have been afforded the opportunity of working at organisations where I have been allowed to put my stamp on my role. Whether this meant replacing an outdated CRM system, installing a new cloud based server, finding more effective suppliers or introducing procedures throughout the office to ensure the space is more conducive to a productive working environment.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2018 to Present)

- Curious and passionate about code - Have been coding since the beginning of 2018, what started as a means to understand the lunch time banter with my engineer colleagues turned to a genuine interest and now career path.
- Fast, independent learner - the Pre-Course was primarily self-guided and self-paced which has allowed me to create effective work habits when working independently.
- Great collaborator - pairing with different programmers on a daily basis, never one to shy away from sharing ideas,

Will be learnt:
